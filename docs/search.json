A data scientist should be an expert in theoretical computer science and programming ability to optimize systems in organizations.\nData scientists and statisticians both use statistics in their daily lives. I primarily believe the difference lies in some of the other tools that each use. Statisticians tend to use more mathematical and possibly econometric theory, whereas data scientists are primarily concerned with the computer science aspect of creating. I believe both have similar mindsets with day-to-day life, and each have desirable skillsets!\nI love both of these areas to be frank. I think I prefer statistician work a bit more, but I love the automation and optimization part of data science. Ideally, I find a position in industry combining my favorite parts of both fields!"
